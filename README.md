consumers that are interested in learning from them.

For Consumers:
The app is designed to provide an opportunity for consumers to follow experts who share their knowlege via the app. Typically, 
the user will scroll through posts, find and article he or she enjoys, and then chooses to follow that expert if the expert's article 
touches on the kind of information the user has joined that app to have access to.

Additional Features:
A feature could be added that allowed the contributors to receive donations or pay from subscriptions using Stripe and its Connected Accounts API which could be a source 
of income for the app, as well. No definitive plans in place at this time.
